# The Missing Map

    Once upon a time, a clever wizard named Peter built a magical tool that powered an entire kingdom.  
When Peter left for a new land, everyone waved goodbye, sure they could keep the magic working. 
   
**Soon, the tool began to fail...**  
  
The remaining wizards looked at Peter's spells but found no scroll explaining how they worked. The magic code was like a maze with no map.  
    
  
  
  
  
Like a hero without a map in a vast forest, the team was lost without documentation.
