# The Missing Map

    Once upon a time, a clever wizard named Peter built a magical tool that powered an entire kingdom.  
When Peter left for a new land, other wizards were sure they could keep the magic working. 
   
**Soon, the tool began to fail...**  
  
The remaining wizards looked at Peter's spells but found no README explaining how they worked.  
The magic code was like a maze with no map.
