# The Midnight Curse

Once upon a time, as midnight, a terrible curse fell upon the castle. All lamps turned red.  
  
  

Wizards found the root cause, the magic spell created by the First Wizard who left years ago.        
They finally fixed it...  


If only the First Wizard had left a simple README of how the spell worked, the curse could have been lifted in minutes instead of hours.
