# The Procrastinator's Tale
Once upon a time, a crafter named Sam raced to finish a magic mirror before the full moon (end of sprint). The mirror worked perfectly in testing.  
**"I'll write down how it works later,"** Sam thought, **"after showing the king."**  
But after the showing came fixes...  
after fixes came new features...   
and after new features came a new project...
  
  
  
  
The guide remained an empty scroll, a good intention never fulfilled.
