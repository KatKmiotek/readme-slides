# The Newcomer's Quest


Once upon a time, a young apprentice named Julia joined a famous guild of code crafters.   
  
**"All the code is there, just dive in!"** they told Julia.  
Julia found a massive library of spells with no guidebook. For three days, she struggled silently, afraid to ask too many questions.  
She pieced together clues from old notes and spell names.  
By week's end, Julia's spirit was crushed.  
It was like being dropped into the middle of an epic quest with no instruction on which monsters to fight.
  
  
Later, when creating their own spells, Julia wrote the most helpful guide in the guild's history, so no newcomer would face the same dark forest alone.
